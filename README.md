# supertram-tracker

The idea is to build an app that works similarly to [Signalbox](https://www.signalbox.io/), but for Sheffield's [Supertram](https://www.travelsouthyorkshire.com/en-GB/supertram/home) network.

Unfortunately, currently there is no publicly-available live tram GPS data. The most info that anyone has is just when trams are expected to be at each stop, which is often incorrect.

The idea is to create an app that can intelligently predict where trams *should* be and display that data to users in order to make it easier to use the tram system.
